# Pilates for Abortion Funds

Pilates for Abortion Funds is a small, independent fundraiser that launched in July 2022 as a way to turn post-Dobbs despair into action.

Since well before Roe v Wade was overturned, access to abortion has been difficult and expensive, making it out of reach for many people who desperately need this critical form of health care, particularly people in challenging financial situations, minoritized groups, and those who live in rural areas. Abortion funds have been operating for many years to help patients cover not only the procedure itself but transportation, lodging, childcare, and other related expenses. The events of summer 2022 made this need even greater and more urgent.

PFAF is a monthly, all-levels, body neutral Pilates class for which the cost of entry is proof of a donation of any amount to a local/state/regional abortion fund of your choice, the WI-based clinic Care for All, or the National Network of Abortion Funds. Since July 2022, we have collectively raised more than $45,000 for abortion funds, and we're looking forward to seeing that number continue to grow.

## How to Donate
To minimize transaction costs (and administrative red tape!) I don't accept donations myself — instead, please donate directly to the National Network of Abortion Funds (or your favorite local abortion fund). Any amount works! Then forward me your donation receipt email. If you make a one-time donation, I'll add you to the next event. If you make a recurring monthly donation, I'll add you to all future events. If you don't already have my email address, please fill out the form below to contact me, and I'll respond so we are connected and you can send your donation receipt.

## How It Works

### 1 / Donate
Donate any amount to your favorite local (city/state/regional) abortion fund or the National Network of Abortion Funds. You can also donate to Care for All, a new independent non-profit clinic in WI. (Preferably a monthly contribution!) 

### 2 / Send Proof
Forward me your confirmation email or send me a screenshot proving your contribution. If you don't have my email address, fill out the form on the Donate page so we can get connected.

### 3 / Get the Invite
I'll add you to the calendar invite with the Zoom info. For a one-off donation, I'll add you to the next event only. For a recurring donation (encouraged!), I'll add you to all future events.

#### What gear do I need?
All you need is a mat, some water, and a comfortable space. If you have a hard floor, you might want two mats, or a beach towel on top of your mat, for a little extra cushioning. Pets are very welcome.

#### What is body-neutral Pilates?
Basically, no diet/weight/body-shape-and-size talk. My focus is 100% on functional fitness and feeling good. Full disclosure: I am a thin, white cis woman teaching through an inclusive, body-neutral lens.

#### I want to join live, but I need my privacy.
It's fine to keep your camera off (though if you'd like to keep it on, it's always nice to see friendly faces!). If you need to use a Zoom display name other than your real name, just let me know in advance so I can admit you to the room.

#### How much money have you raised so far?
Since July 2022, we have collectively donated more than $45,000 to abortion funds!
