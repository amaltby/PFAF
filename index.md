## Pilates for Abortion Funds

Pilates for Abortion Funds is a small, independent fundraiser that launched in July 2022 as a way to turn post-Dobbs despair into action.

Since well before Roe v Wade was overturned, access to abortion has been difficult and expensive, making it out of reach for many people who desperately need this critical form of health care, particularly people in challenging financial situations, minoritized groups, and those who live in rural areas. Abortion funds have been operating for many years to help patients cover not only the procedure itself but transportation, lodging, childcare, and other related expenses. The events of summer 2022 made this need even greater and more urgent.

PFAF is a monthly, all-levels, body neutral Pilates class for which the cost of entry is proof of a donation of any amount to a local/state/regional abortion fund of your choice, the WI-based clinic Care for All, or the National Network of Abortion Funds. Since July 2022, we have collectively raised more than $45,000 for abortion funds, and we're looking forward to seeing that number continue to grow.

# How to Donate
To minimize transaction costs (and administrative red tape!) I don't accept donations myself — instead, please donate directly to the National Network of Abortion Funds (or your favorite local abortion fund). Any amount works! Then forward me your donation receipt email. If you make a one-time donation, I'll add you to the next event. If you make a recurring monthly donation, I'll add you to all future events. If you don't already have my email address, please fill out the form below to contact me, and I'll respond so we are connected and you can send your donation receipt.
